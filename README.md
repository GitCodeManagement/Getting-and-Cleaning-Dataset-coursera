                                              Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The main objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to get and clean the datasets provided. They are
1) Create run_analysis.R Script
2) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5) Create independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

There is only one script - run_analysis.R that handles all of the above five tasks. 
In order to create the final independent tidy data set described in step 5 just need to run run_analysis.R sciprt. 
The input files required to run for the scripts are not attached in this repositoriy. It can be downloaded from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script points to my current working directory which needs to be modified to process the input files and generate the final tidy_data.csv file.
