# This program "run_analysis.R" tasked with getting and cleaning the dataset shared for this assignment
# There are two datasets shared for this assignment 1) test dataset 2) train dataset
# Objective is to clean and load the test and train datasets and combine them into a single dataset
# From the dataset, extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# And Evaluate average of each variable for each activity and each subject and write into a new file

#loading library required for this program
